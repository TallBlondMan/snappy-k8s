[] Deploy images to AWS docker repo
[] Try automaiting the creation of docker repo on AWS

[] Work on Database - maybe a config file for deployment
[] Make the infrastructure for app deploy via Terraform/eksctl
[] Maybe use Jenkins for deployment - deploy Jenkins via Terraform on AWS
[] Use Mongo Replica Set for database - see how it fares with the backend (https://www.mongodb.com/docs/kubernetes-operator/stable/tutorial/deploy-replica-set/)
